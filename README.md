# Recombineering-App
This application helps you to identify TAC clones in Arabidopsis containing the gene(s) of your interest and design primers for recombineering experiments.
Please, make sure the primers and TAC clones suggested by the application will work for you. By default the N-terminus tagging designs the primers to insert the tag just before the ATG. If you want to insert it juts after the ATG simply select 3 after clicking the 'Coordinates of the desired point of the insertion'.
